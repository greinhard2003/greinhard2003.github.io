                    <p>Hello! My name is Garrett Reinhard. My pronouns are <strong>he/him</strong> and I am a <strong>computer science 
                        major</strong> at Cal Poly.
                        I love listening to and playing music in my free time. It helps me release stress and and always helps boost my mood.
                        I am also a part of the </strong>triathlon club</strong>. I've always enjoyed running with friends and I like the sense of accomplishment
                        I get after I do something that pushes me, so I decided to join the club last year and raced my first ever triathlon. I 
                        also enjoy restoring my truck when I'm not playing music. I like being able to see the progress I've made on it since I 
                        bought it after my freshman year in highschool. 
                    </p>
                    <p>All of my computer science experience comes from the classes I've taken at Cal Poly. I have experience coding in python,
                        html, css, and typescript. While my experience is limited I love learning about new ways to approach projects so 
                        I can better understand what my future career could look like. I nerver back away from a challenge and I look forward to
                        working on projects that will push me!
                    </p>
